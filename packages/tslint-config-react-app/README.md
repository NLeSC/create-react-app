TSlint configuration used in `@nlesc/react-scripts` package.

TSlint ruleset which combines:

* tslint-microsoft-contrib
* tslint-react
* tslint:latest

To use in `create-react-app` we overridden several rules to make it compatible with webpack and have similar rules to eslint-config-react-app package.

# Overridden rules

* import-name, webpack allows for import of assets like svg and css
* jsx-alignment, want linting on jsx
* jsx-no-lambda, want linting on jsx
* jsx-no-string-ref, want linting on jsx
* jsx-no-multiline-js, want linting on jsx
* jsx-self-close, want linting on jsx
* member-access, everything that has no access modifier is public implicitly, so no need to specify public again
* missing-jsdoc, not useful for an application, it would be for a library
* no-any, not everything has to be to typed to allow for incrementally introduction of types for eg. 3rd party libraries
* no-relative-imports, not practical for an application, it would be for a library because it has a package name
* no-reserved-keywords, redux requires `type` keyword for a action, the rule doesn't allow us to whitelist `type` so we disabled whole rule
* no-unused-variable:[true, "react"], allow React to be marked used by jsx tags
* quotemark

    * single, single quote because its less typing
    * jsx-double, jsx-double because thats the html way
    * avoid-escape, part of tslint:latest

* variable-name

    * removed check-format, both camelCased and UPPER_CASED vars in same file
    * removed allow-pascal-case, PascalCase is reserved for classes
